# schools-friending-bias

This project builds off of social capital and education policy research from Plural Connections, an interdisciplinary research and action lab based at Northeastern University. Using schools-level data from the Social Capital Atlas, users can explore average friending bias in schools across the U.S. by the school's percentage of specified demographic groups.
